I guess we did alright last year. We all worked our tails off, crossed our fingers, and hoped at least a few hundred furry friends would walk through those doors. Then eight hundred of you rushed Portland like it was doorbusters on Black Friday.

That weekend was an emotional rollercoaster, culminating at Closing Ceremonies when I couldn't hold it in anymore. The nice thing about a fursuit is nobody can tell when you're crying, even under a spotlight. Pouring myself into Furcationland last year was one of the most rewarding experiences in my life.

The embers of last year's Furcationland still glow, and we're excited to stoke the flames of new memories at Furcationland 2024: Fireside Tails!

I am so excited to see what this year will bring. This year's theme, Fireside Tails, is an invitation to gather around the metaphorical hearth, to share stories, laughter, and connection. Just like by a crackling fire, Furcationland offers a shared experience that warms the soul and creates lasting memories.

I'm particularly excited about the pre-con party at Arcadia on Thursday and the Monument Square Menagerie on Saturday. I am absolutely ecstatic that our little convention is reaching out into downtown Portland. No matter how you choose to participate, make the most of every moment. Join us for dances, panels, games, and create your own “Fireside Tails” to share for years to come.

Thank you to all our volunteers, staff, sponsors, and most importantly, you, the attendees. Together, we'll make Furcationland 2024: Fireside Tails a roaring success! Welcome, one and all, to the warmth of our furry community. May your weekend be filled with laughter, connection, and unforgettable tales by the fire.
