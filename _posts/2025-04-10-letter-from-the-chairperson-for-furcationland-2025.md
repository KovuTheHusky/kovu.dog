This past year has been hard for me. It wouldn’t be fair to start this letter any other way. I write this not because I want to bring you down but because I want to remind you of the person underneath that fur, behind those starry eyes, hiding beneath that goofy grin.

There's something uniquely fascinating about this fandom. It allows us to explore the very idea of self, offering a space where we intentionally craft and present different facets of who we are. Yet, within this community, these explorations feel incredibly valid and real. For me, Kovu is my truer self, and those who know me as Kovu understand me in a way that others may not. It’s in this open and accepting environment, this space for self-discovery, that I've drawn strength and felt genuinely supported throughout this past year.

The friends I've made and the deeper connections I've forged this past year have helped me dig out of the hole I had found myself in. Even when it doesn’t feel like it, it’s going to be okay.

Despite the challenges of the past year, my excitement for this year’s convention remains incredibly high. This year's theme, Fuzzytown Fair, has inspired us to expand beyond the hotel and embrace Portland as our very own town fair or carnival.

I am particularly eager to see attendees, both in and out of fursuit, enjoying the various activities: playing games, relaxing in the beer garden, listening to live music, sampling treats from the food trucks, and exploring our expanded car show. Furthermore, I'm delighted that we are returning to Monument Square, where the Fursuit Parade will proceed directly this year, weather permitting.

Beyond just enjoying the planned activities, let's all take this opportunity to reconnect with old friends, strengthen those important bonds, and warmly welcome newcomers into our furry family. This convention is a fantastic chance for each of us to build community and create lasting memories together.

As always, I cannot thank our volunteers, staff, sponsors, and all our attendees enough. Together, we'll make Furcationland 2025 an event to remember! Welcome, one and all, to the Fuzzytown Fair!
